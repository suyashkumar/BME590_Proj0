# Piano Hero
By Suyash, Shana, Amy (group project)

A simple piano game for the first project in BME590 (Mobile Devices for Biomedical Engineering). This project was intended to be a way to dive into Android development since we have never explored it before. The ultimate goal in this class is to design a medical device that communicates with a mobile Android device for control or data display.
